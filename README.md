## Project overview

This project is inspired by Apple’s renowned replacement and warranty policy.
Apple has built a reputation for offering generous repair and replacement services, often providing refurbished devices with minimal friction for the customer. While this strengthens brand loyalty and customer satisfaction, it also raises a key business question:

“Can strong sales growth sustainably offset the rising costs of warranty and replacement services?”

To explore this question, we analyze a dataset labeled as Apple sales and warranty data, obtained from a public source.  
⚠️ The authenticity of this dataset as official Apple data has not been independently verified, and it should be treated as Apple-inspired data for analytical purposes.

The analysis simulates a real-world scenario to evaluate whether revenue growth is sufficient to absorb increasing warranty costs, drawing lessons from Apple’s customer-focused after-sales strategy.
