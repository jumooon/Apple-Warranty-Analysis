## Project overview

This project is inspired by Apple’s well-known replacement and warranty policy.
Apple has built a reputation for providing generous repair and replacement services, often offering refurbished devices with little hassle to the customer. While this strengthens brand loyalty and enhances customer satisfaction, it raises a critical question:

“How can a company afford such a generous warranty policy while remaining highly profitable?”

To explore this question, we simulate a retail business environment with sales and warranty claim data, and analyze whether revenue growth is sufficient to absorb the rising costs of warranty claims.
